-----------------------------------

1. Unzip the original dataset into the working directory. Load the data.table library to use the <mark>fread()</mark> function which reads the training set data (X_train.txt, y_train.txt and subject_train.txt) and test set data (X_test.txt, y_test.txt, subject_test.txt).

2. Use the cbind() and rbind() functions to combine the training and test set data.

3. Use fread() function to read features.txt and activity_labels.txt.
